# NYC Water Analysis
# Overview
This project uses Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks. The technologies and libraries used include Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and BeautifulSoup for web scraping.

# Goals
This projects aims to:
- Investigate patterns in lead/copper levels of water samples in different locations
- Identify and visualize which factors influence lead and copper levels
- Find which areas have the highest concern for drinking water quality
- Classify future water quality levels using machine learning model

# Key Features
- **Data Handling**: Importing data using Pandas and preprocessing with Scikit-Learn utilities such as MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder, and train-test-split.
- **Web Scraping**: Collecting data from the web (specifically NYC zip codes) using BeautifulSoup to ensure dataset validity.
- **Data Visualization**: Generating visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying a RandomForestClassifier to make predictions and evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy score and confusion matrix.
